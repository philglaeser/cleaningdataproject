# Code Book for Data in philglaeser/cleaningdataproject repository

## Overview
The tidy datasets described herein originates from data which is split across 8 data sets.
The original data resulted from an experiment using motion sensors in a smartphone
to measure movements of 30 subjects over 6 activities.

The first goal is to extract only certain types of data measurements, mean and standard deviation, and combine
both the test and trial subjects into one table.  This table is named "CombinedMeanandStd.txt".

The second goal is to summarize this data by taking the mean of the selected measurements grouped by the subject and the activity.
This table is named "MeansOfSelectedVariablesBySubjectAndActivity.txt".

## The Process

Processing the data requires the execution of 1 script,  run_analysis.R
It performs the following steps on the origional data.

### Step 1 
* Read 8 tables into 8 dataframes
* Note, table are assumed to be in the current working directory
* Name the column with the participant id numbers "Subject"

### Step 2
* Create a True/False column in the features data to select the mean and standard deviation columns.
* Note the meanfreq columns are not selected for this data set.
* 66 columns with meand and std data are selected. 

###Step 3 
* Use the data in the activities table to create a column that associates the proper labels to the activity number in the yTest and yTrain tables
* The column with the descriptions are now labeled "Activities"

### Step 4 
* Subset the features table to only those we want to keep
* Create a vector "ColKeep" which is the list of column numbers to keep 
* Create a vector "ColDisc" with the labels of those columns by using make.name to insure legitimate column names
* Subset the xTest andxTrain data to only the columns we want
* Create a vector "existnames" with the existing names of the xT... tables
* Rename the columns by matching existing to the desired names

fs <- subset(features, MS == TRUE)
colKeep <- fs$V1
colDisc <- make.names(fs$V2)

xTest <- subset(xTest[,colKeep])
existnames <- names(xTest)
names(xTest)[match(existnames,names(xTest))] <- colDisc

xTrain <- subset(xTrain[,colKeep])
existnames <- names(xTrain)
names(xTrain)[match(existnames,names(xTrain))] <- colDisc

## Step 5
## Combine the subject, activity, and numeric observations in one frame
##  for the train and test data sets
##  Then, put both data sets together to complete instructions 1 through 4
##  Additionally, write the data to a text file to store on the repository.
xTest <- cbind(subTest,Activity=yTest$Activity,xTest)
xTrain <- cbind(subTrain,Activity=yTrain$Activity,xTrain)
allData <- rbind(xTest,xTrain)
write.table(allData, file = "CombinedMeanandStd.txt",row.name=FALSE)

## Step 6 
## Find the mean for all variables grouped by Subject and Activity.
## 30 Subjects x 6 Activities give 180 observations, each with means for 66 variables.
## Write the result to a file to complete instruction 5
SumData <- allData %>% group_by(Subject, Activity) %>% summarize_each(funs(mean)) 
write.table(SumData, file = "MeansOfSelectedVariablesBySubjectAndActivity.txt",row.name=FALSE)

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ (6)
tGravityAcc-XYZ (6)
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ (6)
tBodyGyro-XYZ (6)
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ (6)
tBodyAccMag (2)
tGravityAccMag (2)
tBodyAccJerkMag (2)
tBodyGyroMag (2)
tBodyGyroJerkMag (2)
fBodyAcc-XYZ (6)
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ (6)
fBodyGyro-XYZ (6)
fBodyAccMag (2)
fBodyAccJerkMag (2)
fBodyGyroMag (2)
fBodyGyroJerkMag (2)

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
