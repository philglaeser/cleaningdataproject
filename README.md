## Combining and Summarizing the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

### This repository contains the following files:

* 'README.md', This file
* 'CodeBook.md, The description of the contents and process to create the datasets included in this repository 
* 'run_analysis.R, An R script which produces the dataset included in this directory from the original data
* 
* 

### Process Execution
The entire process is acomplished by running the script (code) contained in run_analysis.R.
The code assumes that the following original data files are contained in the same directory as the script.

* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'x_train.txt': Training set.
* 'y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'x_test.txt': Test set.
* 'y_test.txt': Test labels.
* 'subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject in the training group who performed the activity. 
* 'subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject in the test group who performed the activity.
